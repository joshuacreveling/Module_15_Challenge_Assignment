# Module 15 Challenge - RoboAdvisor Using AWS Lex and Lambda

## Description

In this excercise, we assume the role of a digital transformation consultant with the goal of creating a robo advisor to engage more customers as well as gain new customers.  The objective of the new robo advisor is to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.  

This challenge is divided into three sections:

* Step 1: Configure the Initial Robo Advisor 
    * Create the robo advisor bot and add an intent with its corresponding slots. 

* Step 2: Build and Test the Robo Advisor 
    * Build and test the robo advisor.  A screen recording is provided in the 'screen_recordings' folder that demonstrates this.

* Step 3: Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function
    * Create an Amazon Lambda function to validate the data that a user supplies during a conversation with the robo advisor.  The Lambda function (lambda_function.py) is located in the 'Lambda' folder located in this repository. 
    * A screen recording is provided in the 'screen_recordings' folder that demonstrates this.
